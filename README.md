# 2048-decision-theory

2048 game simulation for reinforcement learning on decision theory course.

2048
* Moves: slide to left/r/u/d
* End state: all cells are full and there are no possibles moves 
* OR reaching 2048 in one cell
* Random Agent: Generates blocks (power of 2)
* AI agent: do the valid moves
* Rewards: the created number out after slide


* Start with 3x3 and target 64
### Remaining:
* get_all_possible_actions 
* get_all_possible_states
* _calculate_transition_prob
